      This is a simple server for Over-the-Air (OTA) provisioning of so-called MIDlet
      suites, that is, small <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java</a> applications
      conforming to the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/midp">Mobile
      Information Device Profile</a> (MIDP) that can be run on a variety of
      <a href="http://kobjects.org/devicedb">Java-powered mobile phones</a>.
      The following suites are available for download. Click on any of the names
      to initiate the transfer. If you are accessing this page from a mobile
      phone, you might want to use the <a href="index.wml">WAP version</a> instead.

      <p/>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Version</th>
          <th>Vendor</th>
          <th>Size</th>
          <th>Uploaded</th>
          <th>DLs</th>
          <th>Files</th>
        </tr>

  <!-- **********************************************************************
       * The following block is repeated for each available MIDlet. It must
       * be bounded by the BEGIN and END markers, and the markers must appear
       * exactly as they do in this file. In particular there are no
       * additional spaces allowed in the marker lines. To access attributes
       * from a MIDlet's JAD file inside this block, use "${attribute}",
       * where "attribute" denotes any of the attributes allowed in a JAD
       * file plus three extra ones named "File", "Date", and "Counter" that
       * access the JAD's download URL, the MIDlet's upload date, and the
       * download counter (stored in "counter.txt"), respectively.
